As per the ISRO official website, they are broadcasting the Live Landing of Chandrayan-3 mission on August 23, 2023, starting from 17:27 Hrs. IST (5:27 PM).
Let's encourage everyone to see the *Live Landing to mark India's Historic Mission to Moon.*
🌖🇮🇳🛰️

Please click the link to know more: https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3SoftLandingMessage.html
[22/08, 07:05] Dr Sanjay R Joshi: *Chandrayaan 3 update :-*

The powered descent of Vikram Lander is expected to start on Wednesday, August 23, 2023 around 5:47 pm IST..

Expected touch down will be at 6:04 pm (this is modified timing than earlier declared plan)

These last 15 mins of descent are known as *"15 mins of horror"* in ISRO circle. 

*Why??*

Because in this phase Chandrayaan 3 which is in horizontal orientation in about 25 km orbit, will start moving towards the surface of moon at a speed of around *6000 km/hr*, will change its orientation to vertical as it approaches the lunar surface and reduce its speeds to max *3 km/hr* using on-board 4 rockets (in Chandrayaan 2 there were 5) and thursters.

At the height of around 100 metres from ground it will scan the surface and search and select a safe landing place and move towards it using above mentioned Propulsion systems and finally soft land on the moon (all this while by keeping balancing forces in check to keep itself in intended position) and then release Pragyan Rover from its belly to conduct various experiments...

*Sounds exciting ??*

All this final manoeuvering will be fully autonomous, run by on board Computers using various algorithms which are fed into it before lift off..

Its autonomous because it will itself choose which algorithm to use depending on the data it collects at that time. (ISRO command centre won't be able to handle these commands live as these are all split second decisions to be made and the command from earth takes 2.4 to 2.7 seconds to travel to the moon)

It has been fed detailed map of moon surface (4 km × 4.5 kms) where it intends to land. (Chandrayaan 2 was given 500 mts × 500 mts map of then proposed landing site)

There are so many ifs and buts in all these events and we don't know the unknown unknowns in this entire endeavour..

Because of this , last 15 mins of Lander descent are totally unpredictable and hence called as "last 15 mins of horror".

At present It's  systems are being checked and checked again as we speak.

Infact, Chandrayaan 3 is all set to land and start this final phase on the click of button from ISRO command centre even now this minute. 

*Then why are we waiting for 23rd August ??*

Its because the site at which Chandrayaan 3 is planned to land is in dark at present (One lunar night is 14 days duration).. if we land now, the Spacecraft will be deprived off solar energy ..

So we are waiting for dawn (1st light of 14 days sunshine) at landing site...!

*This eagerly awaited event will be broadcast live on Wednesday, August 23, 2023 from 5:27 pm IST on multiple platforms including ISRO website, Its YouTube channel and facebook page, and DD National TV*

So don't miss it... block the day, date and time - Wednesday,  23rd August 2023 starting from 5:27 pm IST for this *grand finale !*

*Don't miss the chance to witness something historical...* 

Remember your grand children will ask you about this day ..

*"तुम्ही / तु त्या वेळेस काय करत होता / होती ?"*

~ I am very disappointed with you all today. I never thought that you would disregard the instructions given by the faculty. They asked you to register for a course, but it seems like you didn't take it seriously. Even the Head of Department sent multiple emails reminding you to register, but your branch is the only one that hasn't registered yet. This kind of behavior is unacceptable. Please be mature and focus on exceptional work, not foolishness.
I can only say that the rest depends on you, you need to be serious in your life.

thread-safe manner.
Implement Exception Handling for invalid salary
values.



Constraints:


Permanent employees get a 10% bonus on their base
salary.
Contract employees do not get bonuses.
